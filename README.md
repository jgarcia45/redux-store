## Description
Refactored the e-commerce platform so that it uses [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).

## Installation
***Requirments***

[React](https://reactjs.org/) | [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

***Once Installed:***
1. Clone the Repository on to your machine.
2. Open the terminal and ensure you are in the right file path.
3. Run the command ```npm install``` to download the packages.
4. Then run the command ```npm start``` to run the software.
5. The application will then begin to run locally.

## User Story
```
AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform
I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API
SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state
WHEN I review the appâ€™s store
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API
WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider
WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state
THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API
WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
```
